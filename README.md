This repository contains a note taking application built with Javascript code and executed with Node.js. This project utilizes npm packages express, uniqid, and fs. 

When initialized, the app displays a homepage where users can click in to begin taking notes. When redirected, a left-hand column displays pre-existing notes while the right-hand column contains empty fields for users to enter new notes. Users have the option to view previous notes by choosing them from the left-hand list, clear a new note entry without saving, or save a new note. User's may also delete notes from the saved list. 

## Installation

## Credits
I utilized node.js documentation regarding file systems while researching how to tackle the DELETE request for this project. I also referenced the UNH Bootcamp repository Express activity "18_Stu_POST-Fetch" and Express activity "22_Stu_Modular-Routing" when making desicions regarding file structure and coding framework for this project.
